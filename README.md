This is a Blind Face Restoration (BFR) model for EPFL semester project.

The model is based on ControlNeXt and StableDiffusion XL.

Hardware requirement: A single GPU with at least 24GB memory.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shua-chen/BFR-Model.git
cd BFR-Model-Train
```

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the training script:

```bash
bash train_cluste.sh
```

The output will be saved in `trains/example`.


For inference, first download the pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mWBG_xzzwBm4rLYoKMCprXUr1i8qaS2V?usp=sharing) and put it in `pretrained_models/`.

Put the image path you want to restore in `--validation_image` in script.sh.
